# libdash


libdash is the **official reference software of the ISO/IEC MPEG-DASH standard** and is an open-source library that provides an object orient (OO) interface to the MPEG-DASH standard, developed by [bitmovin](http://www.bitmovin.com).

Video encoding 100x faster than any other encoding service
Your videos play everywhere with low startup delay, no buffering and in the highest quality

### NETFLIX GRADE QUALITY
Encode your content with the same technology as Netflix and YouTube in a way that it plays everywhere with low startup delay and no buffering. bitcodin encodes your content 100x faster than any other competitor while providing such a high quality output.

### API & DOCUMENTATION
bitcodin is a powerful cloud encoding tool for developers built by developers. The bitcodin API is available in our developer section including comprehensive documentation and API client for different programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, PHP, NodeJS, etc.

### HTML5 ADAPTIVE STREAMING
bitcodin enables HTML5 adaptive streaming with MPEG-DASH native in your browser with no need for plugins like Flash or Silverlight. Due to the native integration with the browser it is possible to play back very high resolutions such as 4K or very high framrates like 60fps.

## Features

* Cross platform build system based on cmake that includes Windows, Linux and Mac.
* Open source available and licensed under the LGPL.
* Comprehensive doxygen documentation
* Implements the full MPEG-DASH standard according to ISO/IEC 23009-1, Information Technology Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) Part 1: Media Presentation Description and Segment Formats
* Handles the download and xml parsing of the MPD. Based on that it provides an OO based interface to the MPD.
* Media elements, e.g., SegmentURL, SegmentTemplate, etc., are downloadable in that OO based structure and can be downloaded through libdash, which internally uses libcurl.
* Therefore basically all protocols that libcurl supports, e.g., HTTP, FTP, etc. are supported by libdash.
* However it also provides a configurable download interface, which enables the use of external connections that can be implemented by the user of the library for the download of media segments.
* The use of such external connections will be shown in the libdash_networkpart_test project which is part of libdash solution and also part of the cross platform cmake system and therefore usable on Windows, Linux and Mac.
* The project contains a QT-based sample multimedia player that is based on ffmpeg which uses libdash for the playback of one of our dataset MPDs.
* The development is based on Windows, therefore the code contains a VS10 solution with additional tests and the sample multimedia player.

## Professional Services

In addition to the public available open source resources and the mailing list support, we provide professional development and integration services, consulting, high-quality streaming componentes/logics, relicensing of libdash etc. based on your individual needs. Feel free to contact us via sales@bitmovin.net so we can discuss your requirements and provide you an offer.

## bitdash - Advanced MPEG-DASH Clients


On top of libdash, we provide our [bitdash adaptation framework] (http://www.bitmovin.com), which significantely boosts the streaming performance of MPEG-DASH. It enables up to 100 % higher media throughput than Apple HLS, and 50 % more than Microsoft Smooth Streaming. Additionally it comes together with streaming management functionalities, oscillation prevention mechanisms, DRM key management, multi-source (multi-CDN) support, and much more. It targets embedded platforms such as smartphones, TV-Sets, Set-Top Boxes, etc. and is available on any platform, including Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, etc. Furthermore, we've implementations for HTML5 (MSE) as well as Adobe Flash

Please do not heasitate and contact sales@bitmovin.net to get further information on [bitdash] (http://www.bitmovin.com/)!


## Architecture
<p align="justify">The general architecture of MPEG-DASH is depicted in the figure below where the orange parts are standardized, i.e., the MPD and segment formats. The delivery of the MPD, the control heuristics and the media player itself, are depicted in blue in the figure. These parts are not standardized and allow the differentiation of industry solutions due to the performance or different features that can be integrated at that level. libdash is also depicted in blue and encapsulates the MPD parsing and HTTP part, which will be handled by the library. Therefore the library provides interfaces for the DASH Streaming Control and the Media Player to access MPDs and downloadable media segments. The download order of such media segments will not be handled by the library this is left to the DASH Streaming Control, which is an own component in this architecture but it could also be included in the Media Player.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In a typical deployment, a DASH server provides segments in several bitrates and resolutions. The client initially receives the MPD through libdash which provides a convenient object orient interface to that MPD. The MPD contains the temporal relationships for the various qualities and segments. Based on that information the client can download individual media segments through libdash at any point in time. Therefore varying bandwidth conditions can be handled by switching to the corresponding quality level at segment boundaries in order to provide a smooth streaming experience. This adaptation is not part of libdash and the MPEG-DASH standard and will be left to the application which is using libdash.

## Documentation

The doxygen documentation availalbe in the repo.

## Sources and Binaries

You can find the latest sources and binaries on github.

## How to use

### Windows
1. Download the tarball or clone the repository from github (git://github.com/bitmovin/libdash.git)
2. Open the libdash.sln with Visual Studio 2010
3. Build the solution
4. After that all files will be provided in the bin folder
5. You can test the library with the sampleplayer.exe. This application simply downloads the lowest representation of one of our dataset MPDs.

### Ubuntu 12.04
1. sudo apt-get install git-core build-essential cmake libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
2. git clone git://github.com/bitmovin/libdash.git
3. cd libdash/libdash
4. mkdir build
5. cd build
6. cmake ../
7. make
8. cd bin
9. The library and a simple test of the network part of the library should be available now. You can test the network part of the library with
10. ./libdash_networpart_test
